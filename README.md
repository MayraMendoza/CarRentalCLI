In this application you will be creating a Java command line interface application. This application will simulate a car rental app from the renter’s perspective.
Then they will be given the option to “Rent” or “Return” a car. When the application starts, Car objects will be generated and stored in the company's “garage”. 
If the user selects an option to rent, a selection menu will appear where the user can select a car they want to rent using a list of numbers where each number is associated with a Car object. 
When a car is selected with a valid number, the user will be taken back to the first menu where they can select “Rent” or “Return”
